* Counting the contained storage in area `(2r+1) x (2h+1) x (2r+1)` around you with `/countaround <r> <h>`
* Counting the contained storage in area with cord `/count <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>`

Recursive counting accounts for bundles and shulkers.\
Tables are saved in the `.minecraft/storage-counter` folder.
